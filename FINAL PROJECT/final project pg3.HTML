      <li>Gaming<dd>Playing single player games is my favourite hobby because I also get to think while also feeling like I'm watching a movieat the same time</dd></li>
      <li>Programming<dd>I love programming because it challenges me in ways that I cannot get from video games and the benefit is that what I learn can be passed on into the real world</dd></li>
      <li>Listening to music<dd>Listening to music helps me relax alot and sometimes while I do so I also think of certain ways I can write codes</dd></li>
